## Sweett

Sweett is a time tracker and goal setting app specifically catered towards software engineering job seekers. [Live Site Link](https://swett.herokuapp.com/#/)

## Background and Overview

**It is difficult to strike a balance between various tasks and figuring out what category you might be lacking in during the job search.** There are so many important categories in the jobs search you must put some time into, yet so little time to put your heart and soul to all of them. Categories such as:
* data structures and algorithms 
* mock interviews 
* side projects 
* _Cracking the Coding Interview_ 

and other self-studying related materials are crucial for a successful job search. This app addresses and mitigates this struggle by:

* recording all the tasks you have done for each category. 
* recording all the time you spent working on various tasks in each category and present you total time allotted for each category.
* allowing users to set goals for each category and the time frame for each goal.

This will help visualize and understand what areas users need to improve and spend more time on. This will also promote organization and time management during the job search. Ultimately, this app will provide a better job search experience.

## Functionality and MVP

* Upon signing up, users will start with four default categories that cannot be deleted: Leetcode, Mock Interviews, Cracking the Coding Interview (books), and Side Projects

* Users can add, edit, or delete a new leetcode question and the desired time to complete it. Each question can contain multiple attempts. Users can time themselves to answer a question and save it as an attempt. Users can set a time limit for an attempt and this counts towards total time accumulated for this category.

* Users can record their mock interviews in this category. Users can schedule mock interviews with other users. Optional: Users can send DMs with other users and maybe in groups.

* Users can add, edit, or delete problems in the book _Cracking the Coding Interview_. Like the Leetcode Category, users can time themselves to answer a question and save it as an attempt. Optional: Users can change the name of this category if they are using a different book. 

* Users can record their side projects. They can keep track of the time they spent on the projects and add any notes on changes and what needs to be done later.

* Users can create, modify, and delete custom categories. Not only can they set the name and type of category, they can set goals and time limit for them. Users can create up to 12 categories, including the default 4.

### Bonus Features

* Keeping track of applications sent and replies. Showing graphs/charts of activity and response:rejection ratio.

* A category to record coding challenges and failed interview attempts.

* Mobile friendly

* Getting it to the App Store

## Technologies and Challenges

Sweett's core application is the ability to track time for each task and set goals for each category. Upon logging in/signing up, users are greeted with a dashboard containing four default categories: Leetcode, Cracking the Coding Interview, Mock Interviews, and Side Projects. Users can create more categories as needed and can visit any one of them at anytime. Depending on the category, users can create, modify, and delete entries and goals, and time themselves and record them as attempts.
